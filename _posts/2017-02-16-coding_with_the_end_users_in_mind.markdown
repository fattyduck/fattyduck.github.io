Ever heard the phrase: "Every action we take is for an end goal and we know it, whether it's consciously or unconsciously."? This phrase is believed to be created by Dison, which happens to be me (I am probably not the first to say it but a quick google search came up with no results, let's just assume I am the original creator). I would boldly that understanding what our end goal is consciously and taking action specifically to reach the end goal is by far the most efficient way to accomplish our goals.

All that being said, as programmers, our action taken is coding and our end goal is to solve a problem for people who are going to be the recipients of our code. With technology being more and more complicated, more often than not, most programmers write code to solve problems for other programmers and not the mass public. This is something I had wish I have known when I first started coding. It would have been much easier to understand why following conventions is **essential** and writing clean code at the expense of marginal performance is the major mode of this industry.
